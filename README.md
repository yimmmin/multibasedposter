# multibasedposter

Inspired by a poster of Steve Jobs, I try to make a poster composed of many other smaller pictures.

Basically, I use Web crawler to fetch plenty photos, then formalize them into the same size and select the right photos to be situated at the right positions by using match-function.

Match-function's algorithm is that divide one pic into several block and chose one particular color as the representative color, then match the final poster picture's block color.
